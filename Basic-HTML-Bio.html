  <p>I am an Atlanta native (born and raised). Graduated from Agnes Scott College in (don't ask) with a BA in Physics. Worked for two years
      as an AmeriCorps VISTA for two technology driven projects: Teaming for TECHnology Atlanta and CTCnet VISTA Project in Chicago IL.
      Also I am a roller coaster enthusiast, self proclaimed Trekkie, Hello Kitty connoisseur and anime manic. Love to learn new exciting things.</p>
  <br>

  <p>Love music of all genres (except acid jazz..can not comprehend the randomness of notes just being played. Love to read Sci Fi, horror and 
      thriller novels. I was a bookworm when I was younger, but now adulting has taken over that piece of pleasure for the time being. Love movies
      in the Sci-Fi, horror, comedy and thriller genres.</p>
